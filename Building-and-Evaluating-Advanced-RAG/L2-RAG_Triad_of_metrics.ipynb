Even after the system has hit the target, further iteration may \\nbe necessary to address post-deployment drift.\\n Working on projects often means collaborating with \\nstakeholders who lack expertise in AI:\\nWhile searching for a job in AI can be similar to searching for a job in \\nother sectors, there are also important differences.  Many companies are \\nstill trying to figure out which AI skills they need, and how to hire people \\nwho have them.

In addition, the \\nhighly iterative nature of AI projects leads to special challenges in project \\nmanagement: How can you come up with a plan for building a system \\nwhen you don’t know in advance how long it will take to achieve the target \\naccuracy?

In addition, the \\nhighly iterative nature of AI projects leads to special challenges in project \\nmanagement: How can you come up with a plan for building a system \\nwhen you don’t know in advance how long it will take to achieve the target \\naccuracy?  Even after the system has hit the target, further iteration may \\nbe necessary to address post-deployment drift.\\n Working on projects often means collaborating with \\nstakeholders who lack expertise in AI:\\nWhile searching for a job in AI can be similar to searching for a job in \\nother sectors, there are also important differences.

I’m fortunate to \\nhave been able to apply neural networks to everything from autonomous helicopter flight to \\nonline advertising, partly because I jumped in when relatively few people were working on \\nthose applications.

Keeping up-to-date with rapidly evolving technology: The context emphasizes that AI is a nascent field with many technologies still in development, making it crucial to continuously learn and adapt.\\n\\n2. Iterative nature of AI projects: The high iteration required in AI projects can pose challenges in project management, as it's difficult to predict the timeline and return on investment, and further iterations may be necessary post-deployment to address drift.\\n\\n3. Collaborating with non-AI experts: Working on AI projects often involves collaborating with stakeholders who may lack AI expertise, which can present unique challenges.\\n\\n4. Overcoming imposter syndrome: Many individuals, including those who have published seminal AI papers, have faced technical challenges, indicating that imposter syndrome can be prevalent in the field.\\n\\n5. Choosing the right application area: While advancing basic AI technology is important, the context suggests that focusing on a specific application area can provide unique opportunities for creative work.\\n\\n6. Balancing depth and breadth of knowledge: The useful depth of knowledge required in AI can change over time, as techniques mature and become more reliable, potentially reducing the need for deep mathematical understanding.\\n\\n7. Team dynamics and communication: The context highlights the importance of having good teammates or people to discuss ideas with, indicating that effective collaboration and communication can be challenging.\\n\\n8.

In the context of AI, newcomers may experience this syndrome, feeling unworthy of belonging in the AI community despite their progress. This issue is not unique to AI; it affects approximately 70% of people at some point in their careers, including accomplished figures like Sheryl Sandberg, Michelle Obama, Tom Hanks, and Mike Cannon-Brookes. The book emphasizes that even those who have published significant AI papers have faced similar technical challenges, implying that imposter syndrome is a common experience in the field.  \n",
